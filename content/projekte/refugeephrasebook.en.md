[Refugeephrasebook.de](http://refugeephrasebook.de) organises volunteer translations and distributes useful information for refugees and helpers. Together with partner institutions in Germany, Greece and the Netherlands, the refugee phrasebook team develops sustainable communication tools to share phrases, icons and helpful links. All materials are adaptable for local needs and distributed with open licenses to foster communication between refugees, citizens and helpers all over Europe. Our goal is to empower refugees all across Europe to communicate and voice their needs, independently of network access and battery life, even if they can only stay in a country for a limited time. With adaptable designs and collections of important phrases, helpful links and essential information, we aim to connect and support initiatives with refugee groups, to foster a sustainable culture of welcome combined with the values of an open society. 

We supported the refugeephrasebook.de volunteer [team](http://www.refugeephrasebook.de/impressum/) with coordination and a [donation](http://www.refugeephrasebook.de/donations/) account to support costs for printing.

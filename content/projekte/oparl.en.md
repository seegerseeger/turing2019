Many municipalities, counties and regions in Germany have council information systems at their disposal in order to organise committee work in local councils and  at district assemblies. A lot of information is hidden in these council information systems of German municipalities. On the one hand, the entire municipal policy is documented - decisions that have a direct impact on the inhabitants of the city. If you want to involve citizens in the city's politics and use their creative potential, it is important to provide information.

OParl is committed to creating uniform access to these information systems in order to develop a classic open data interface. In this way, the entire potential of the Open Data Community can be exploited. Developers and designers are given the opportunity to present new information and, for example, to better involve citizens in decision-making processes. Transparency does not only benefit interested citizens: other data recipients would be journalists, bloggers, scientists and many more. And last but not least, OParl is a form of digital economic development.

A number of council proposals in various cities already show that OParl is an important part of an open data and e-government strategy. Projects such as Politik bei Uns and Frankfurt Gestalten or the work of Abgeordnetenwatch.de show the high interest and the possibilities in the use of council information systems.

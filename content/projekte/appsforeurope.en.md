Apps for Europe was a program intended to showcase the impact of open data in terms of its economic potential. 
Neelie Kroes, former Vice President of the European Commission and a strong supporter of Apps for Europe, quantifies the value of open data at several billion Euros. 
The Consortium behind Apps for Europe wants to facilitate the exploration of the value of open data by helping entrepreneurs to transform their ideas into successful businesses, that can gain foothold all over Europe.

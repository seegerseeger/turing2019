Coding da Vinci is the first cultural data hackathon in Germany that brings together cultural heritage institutions and the hacker/designer community to develop ideas and prototypes for the cultural sector and the public.
More and more galleries, libraries, archives and museums (GLAMs) are digitalizing their collections to make them accessible online and to preserve our heritage for future generations. Only when cultural data is made openly available (according to the Open Definition) can it serve as the creative basis for innovative new applications and projects. Coding da Vinci proactively approaches GLAMs and encourages them to release cultural data, in order to offer their participants a platform to experiment and to innovate.

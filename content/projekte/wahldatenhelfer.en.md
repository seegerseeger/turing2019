The "Wahl.Daten.Helfer." was originally a platform on which hackathons can be announced for elections. We wanted to meet not only to deal with the current election data, but also to develop toolsets and apps for upcoming elections, which can be easily adapted and used for example for the European elections.

The project was continued as a community project with an extended focus. The Wahl.Daten.Helfer now helps you to inform yourself about parties and their programs.

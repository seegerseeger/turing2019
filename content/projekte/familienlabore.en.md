The shaping of family life in Germany has changed enormously in recent decades. Patchwork families, multi-generation houses and households of single parents bring completely different requirements with them. One of the biggest challenges is the compatibility of family and career. Or to put it another way: Is it really necessary to have to sit in a doctor's waiting room for three hours each time? We think: this works better.

The family labs are a non-profit workshop format to think about the compatibility of family and career together with family members, local interest representatives and technology experts  and to develop concrete, prototypical solutions. This can be the waiting room app. Or making regional data on education and leisure opportunities accessible to people who are not interested in technology. Or a digital open source tool for better shopping coordination within families. Everything that burns under the nails of the participants in the family labs and for which there are technical solutions. In the form of crazy workshop formats with comics, mini robots, click/paper prototypes and photo novestories everything becomes possible!

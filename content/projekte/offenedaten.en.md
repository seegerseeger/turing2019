The goal of Offene Daten was to create the prototype of a data portal for openly accessible administrative data that had not been available in Germany before. Offenedaten.de was used as a data catalogue for the Apps 4 Germany competition, which took place in 2011. In the programming competition, 77 innovative applications for citizens were programmed from 320 data sets and 112 ideas.

From 2014, the [beta version of the portal](http://beta.offenedaten.de) will also contain the total metadata of the [Open Data Monitor](http://www.open-data-map.de) project. The aim was to record the offers of open data in the public sector in Germany as comprehensively as possible, to process them according to subject areas and to make them searchable in a user-friendly and geographical manner with reasonable effort. (= 11,191 municipalities, several dozen state authorities per federal state, federal authorities and public enterprises at all three levels).

The main addressees were students, scientists and journalists as well as app developers who want to know which local authorities offer open data on a specific topic. The main result of the project for OffeneDaten.de was to link the data with site-specific organisations that do not always publish data directly (e.g. sorting out data by municipality in [govdata.de](http://www.govdata.de) or displaying a data result from a domain-specific search on Google). The data are thus for the first time on OffeneDaten.de [mapped](http://beta.offenedaten.de/map). The portal serves as an opportunity to compare the data offered by different sites, including data that is catalogued but not (yet) open (vs. [govdata.de](http://www.govdata.de), which only lists open data in the narrow sense).

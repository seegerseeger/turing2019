### Association and umbrella organization

We are committed to the dissemination of free and openly accessible knowledge in society. We see ourselves as an active part of German and European civil society. Our work is independent, non-partisan, interdisciplinary and non-commercial.

We are present in numerous areas of society and are recognized as one of the leading organizations for innovative projects in the areas of rule of law, transparency and accountability, access to knowledge and participation, digital literacy and public control in Germany and Europe.

We are also the German branch of the globally active [Open Knowledge Network](https://okfn.org/network/).
